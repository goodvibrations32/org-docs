*** Decimation and downsampling
This technique is used when a lot of data points where provided but the overall standard deviation of the signal is giving away an periodic cycle and could be related with a vibration. Then the signal could be cutted to smaller `chunks` for faster analysis.


In digital signal processing, downsampling, compression, and decimation are terms associated with the process of resampling in a
multi-rate digital signal processing system. Both downsampling and decimation can be synonymous with compression, or they can describe
an entire process of bandwidth reduction (filtering) and sample-rate reduction.[1][2] When the process is performed on a sequence of
samples of a signal or a continuous function, it produces an approximation of the sequence that would have been obtained by sampling the
signal at a lower rate (or density, as in the case of a photograph).

*** Multi rate Digital signal processing
In many areas of digital signal processing (DSP) applications—such as communications, speech, and audio processing—rising or lowering of
a sampling rate is required. The principle that deals with changing the sampling rate belongs essentially to multirate signal processing
(Ifeachor and Jervis, 2002; Porat, 1997; Proakis and Manolakis, 1996; Sorensen and Chen, 1997).
As an introduction, we will focus on sampling rate conversion; that is, sampling rate reduction or increase.

This process is refeared as *downsampling of data sequence*. This produces an aliasing effect in the signal which should be avoided.


*** Aliasing
In signal processing and related disciplines, aliasing is an effect that causes different signals to become indistinguishable (or aliases of one another) when sampled.
It also often refers to the distortion or artifact that results when a signal reconstructed from samples is different from the original continuous signal.

Aliasing can occur in signals sampled in time, for instance [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio][digital audio]], or the stroboscopic effect, and is referred to as temporal aliasing. It can also occur in spatially sampled signals
(e.g. moiré patterns in digital images); this type of aliasing is called spatial aliasing.

Aliasing is generally avoided by applying low-pass filters or anti-aliasing filters ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aliasing_filter][AAF]]) to the input signal before sampling and when converting a signal from a higher to a lower sampling rate.
Suitable [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing][reconstruction filtering]] should then be used when restoring the sampled signal to the continuous domain or converting a signal from a lower to a higher sampling rate.

For [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_anti-aliasing][spatial-anti-aliasing]], the types of anti-aliasing include:
 1. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_approximate_anti-aliasing][fast sample anti-aliasing (FSAA)]],
    - Description
      Fast approximate anti-aliasing (FXAA) is a screen-space anti-aliasing algorithm created by Timothy Lottes at Nvidia.
      FXAA 3 is released under a public domain license. A later version, FXAA 3.11, is released under a 3-clause BSD license.

**** The solution to the problem
They propose an FIR lp filter for cutting off the unwanted frequencies.
<<

- To verify this principle, let us consider a signal x (n ) generated by the following:

  x (n ) = 5 sin ((2π × 1000n )/8000) + cos ((2π × 2500n )/8000), (12.8)

  with a sampling rate of f s = 8,000 Hz, the spectrum of x (n ) is plotted in the first graph in Figure 12-3a, where we observe that the signal has components at frequencies of 1,000 and 2,500 Hz.

    Now we downsample x (n ) by a factor of 2, that is, M = 2. According to Equation (12.3), we know that the new folding frequency is 4000/2 = 2000 Hz.
    Hence, without using the anti-aliasing lowpass filter, the spectrum would contain the aliasing frequency of 4 kHz – 2.5 kHz = 1.5 kHz introduced by 2.5 kHz, plotted in the second graph
    in Figure 12-3a.

** Computation of DFT

*** Intro
- The DFT has important role in DT signal-processing. Also there are efficient algorithms for programming (python, C++..).  They are called FFT algorithms (Fast Fourier Transform) but they are calculating all /N values of the DFT/. If only a portion of the frequencies are needed (0 <= ω <= 2π) other algorithms could be more efficient.
[[file:~/Downloads/descrete domain signal book.pdf::602]]


** DFT analysis of signals

*** Intro
- For a finite-length signals the DFT provides frequency-domain samples of the discrete-time Fourier transform, and the implications of this sampling must be clearly understood.
***** Example
- In linear filtering or convolution implemented by multiplying DFTs rather than discrete-time Fourier transforms,a circular convolution is implemented and special care **must** be taken to ensure that the results will be equivalent to a linear convolution.

[[file:~/Downloads/descrete domain signal book.pdf::719]]

*** Windowing effect
- The purpose of the window in the time-dependent Fourier transform is to limit the extend of the sequence to be transformed so the spectral characteristics are reasonably stationary over the duration of the window.

  /**The more rapidly the signal characteristics change, the shorter the window should be**/

*** Sampling in Time and Frequency

* Laboratory case study

** General idea and method
*** Intro
In the present case study the aim is to find a way to filter Electromagnetic Interference at 10-20 kHz via digital signal processing (DSP). The reason for choosing a post-process filtering is the ability to create a system agnopstic processing that could be implemented accross platforms and construction standards. The main goal is to remove those frequencies and find a best way for filtering this particular type of distortion.

As examined with rasing the sampling frequency a surtain amount of noise is imported with distinguishable distortion of the original signal. This could be avoided by reduction of the sampling frequency, but this will introduce Aliasing effect. This was observed when a last recording of the signal with the wind tunnel and were appearing to be less affected than the compressed air measurements. #NOTE Add to the description the reason for

*** UNIV Laboratory setup and measurement tools
- Setup
  The idea is to measure Wind speed produced from a large fan inlet inside contained environment to control the direction. After that a wide-angle and a matrix like (setting chamber) diffusers are used for the even distribution of air flow. At the last section there is a contraction section for regulating the area of the test section. This is due to construction size and lab space. ??????????
